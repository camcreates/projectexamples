            <h2>Why I would be a good fit for the Customer Success Engineer role</h2>
            <p>In my previous full-time role I did front end dev and UX design on a small team serving an entire college.</p>
            <p>Aside from designing and developing new things with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and other web technologies, one of the most fulfilling aspects of my job was working directly with clients on projects, training those with access to the CMS and helping them overcome challenges they encountered in the process. I was also responsible for documenting processes and procedures, user research, testing, debugging and doing my best to make content accessible.</p>
            <p>Prior to becoming a developer, I also got to work in a role where I was responsible for creating instructional courses—including copy, video and additional multimedia—to help small business owners learn how to use social media to market and grow their businesses. I spent a significant amount of time before that working as a freelance writer and editor while doing language and cultural exchange work abroad.</p>
            <p>I also have worked as a server in a restaurant, where I learned how to assist and serve customers when they were both angry and hungry. That proved to be a one-of-a-kind challenge!</p>
            <p>All of these experiences have taught me how to work with clients and customers, overcome obstacles and how to use challenges and issues as an opportunity to make things better. I am accustomed to working remotely, collaborating and providing support via email, instant message, video conferencing, support tickets, phone and in-person.</p>

            <h2>Why I want to work at Raisely</h2>
            <p>I want to work in a role that is client and user-oriented, where I can apply my experience in both development and support to make a difference, and Raisely seems to provide the perfect opportunity to do that. I want to work in a capacity that will leave me feeling fulfilled and proud of what I do, give me plenty of chances to learn and grow and that I will feel motivated and positive about even on the days when I may be spending most of my time on some of my less preferred tasks.</p>
            <p>I've invested time into learning about Raisely and the platform and would love to play my part in helping the organizations Raisely works with. I previously worked at a non-profit college, have been involved in human rights efforts in the communities I have lived in and I have volunteered on a project for the National Rhino Foundation. The organizations and people Raisely aims to serve are exactly the type I want to help make a difference with. I would like for my skills and time to contribute to efforts to make the world a better place as opposed to just turning a profit.</p>

            <h2>Most exciting tasks</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Work with developers to debug and resolve a product issue</li>
                <li>Plan new product features based on feedback from customers</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Solving problems is one of the most fulfilling and rewarding parts of both development and customer service/client relations in my opinion. Both of these tasks provide the opportunity to improve the product based upon the actual needs of the customers and help correct or mitigate potential negative experiences.</p>

            <h2>Tasks I want to learn</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Importing data into a new Kepla account</li>
                <li>Writing a new support article on how to optimise your donation form</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In all honesty, I generally want to learn anything I don't already know how to do because learning is my obsession. These two tasks caught my attention for being two of the things that would be most new to me.</p>

            <h2>Least exciting tasks</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Updating the developer docs to cover a new release</li>
                <li>Responding to 20 support emails</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I struggled on this part a bit because I find it difficult to decide I don't want to do something that I haven't tried yet. Even though I have experience doing a number of things on this list, the environment and context are different than what they would be at Raisely. So I selected two tasks that seemed like they would be the most routine.</p>

            <h2>A company that does customer support well and why</h2>
            <p>As many of my favorite applications seem to being updated with less and less regard for user feedback, this question gets more and more difficult to answer.</p>
            <p>One company that does do it well is Kawashima-ya, the company I source various fermentation starters from. They provide timely updates regarding orders, quickly respond to inquiries and concerns and provide detailed information with each order. They also put out a lot of information about cultured foods and traditional fermentation, preservation and preparation techniques.</p>
            <p>Their dedication to communication and education helps support the success of the customers in the pursuit of culinary traditions.</p>
